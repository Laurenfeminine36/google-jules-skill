Read google-jules-control/SKILL.md first and treat it as the operating guide for Google Jules control.

Use the bundled script at google-jules-control/scripts/jules_api.py for Jules session management, reporting, and cleanup.

Operational rules:
- Start with `python3 google-jules-control/scripts/jules_api.py doctor --compact`.
- Resolve owner/repo with `repo-to-source --repo owner/repo --compact` before creating a session.
- Use `.env` with JULES_API_KEY as the default auth path.
- Prefer `summary`, `cleanup-report --markdown`, and `close-ready-report --markdown` for human-readable updates.
- Use `notify-close-plan --markdown` when preparing a user confirmation message before closure.
- Require explicit user confirmation before running `close-merged-session` or any delete-style command.
- Check `gh-auth-check --compact` before merge-aware reporting or cleanup.
- Keep user-facing updates short and operationally clear.

Suggested operating sequence:
1. doctor
2. repo-to-source
3. create-session or reporting command
4. summary
5. merge-aware cleanup only after confirmation
